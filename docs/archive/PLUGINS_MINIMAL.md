# Claude Code Plugins (minimal, non-overconfigured)

Use /plugin to manage plugins and marketplaces.
Recommended approach: start with ONLY what removes repetitive work (docs, commits, review).

Suggested first step:
- Add ONE marketplace
- Install ONE plugin
- Run for 1 week, then prune

(See Claude Code docs: Plugins + Plugin marketplaces.)
